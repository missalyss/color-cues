# The game and rules
> Based off of the board game Hues and Cues

Users sit in a circle, each at their own device. Users go to color-cues.surge.sh

Select "guesser" or "hinter"

Hinter gives a word to describe the color. And hits a timer (which isn't built yet). During that time, guesses select the closest color they can. After the timer is up, they show their first guess to the hinter.

Hinter gives another guess (can say 2 words this time). Same thing.

I'll figure out scoring eventually.
