# The game and rules
> Based off of the board game Hues and Cues

Users sit in a circle, each at their own device. Users go to color-cues.surge.sh

Select "guesser" or "hinter"

## Hues Cues Rues:
Hinter gives a word to describe the color. And hits a timer (which isn't built yet). During that time, guesses select the closest color they can. After the timer is up, they show their first guess to the hinter.

Hinter gives another guess (can say 2 words this time). Same thing.

I'll figure out scoring eventually.

## Solo player
Go to Hinter page. Copy the value and study it.
Then go to Guesser page and put in three tries depending on what you can remember
plug in answer and see which is your best

## Simple Kids (2 player)
One Hinter, many guessers. Hinter can say as much as they want with each guess. They can describe items near by, use anything they want withotu showing the color.

After each guess, guessers show Hinter what they chose. Hinter continues to describe best they can what kind of color.
